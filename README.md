# USTC_labs
Some projects required for my experimental courses encountered during my undergraduated years in USTC.
!!Don't just copy for ur homework or labs!!
There will be code review in USTC lab checks and my code isn't perfect which means it contains some bugs and won't pass all the test samples!!
