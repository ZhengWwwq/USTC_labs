# USTC_labs
### Introduction
This repository is to record the code for my labs during my undergraduated period in USTC.

My aim is to help students in USTC or anyone intrested in computer science or data science to help deal with some problems.

My code will conly order u a basic train of thought to deal with the problems. Some may have some bugs in it and won't pass all the test cases maybe!
So, be careful to use it and never just copy it for ur lab!!!
